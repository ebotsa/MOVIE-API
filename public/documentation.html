	<p> "This is a MOVIE API for an application called “myFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies. The target audience for this API are front end developers who will build interactive front end designs that utilise this API. Another target group are movie lovers who appreciate an app that helps list all the information they need about their favorite movies" </p>
	<p> It will be built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB and will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational way. </p>
